This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
I am from the United Kingdom and have been living in Northern Kentucky with my wife since December 2023. I am a massive baseball fan, my team is the Giants but I also gollow the Reds as being a mile from Cincinnati! Love music and playing video games is also a hobby of mine.
